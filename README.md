Project Owner:
==============

My name is Anthony S Nwankwo and this is the Readme.md file for my GitHub (also hosted on heroku),
which is a markdown document. It contains the latest update to files in
my project portfolio (Project 03)

Overview/description of the project
===================================


The goal of this project is to build out a Todo and Contact App. I have tailored it to be used by a teacher to track tasks assigned to his/her students :

* 	allows the teacher-instructor to enter the name of the student, the assigned task and toggle the status of completion
* 	allows each record to be edited (for updates or unintentional mistakes)
* 	allows the user to mark todo item as completed (by using a strike-out and without deleting the record)
* 	allows user to PERMANENTLY delete any record 
* 	user can display all completed todos or active todos or ALL todos
*   user can toggle completion status for the home page WITHOUT navigating away to the edit form
* 	ON A SEPARATE case, create a contact list, display it OR delete any contact from the display panel 


The tecnologies used for the project are:


* Flexbox CSS
* Bootstrap 4
* Javascript, React, React-bootstrap, React-Redux, React Router, Context API, Reducers, Hooks
* Functional React Components are used (100%)
* HTML5
* CSS
* Boostrap Menu NAV BAR that persists across all pages



Ideas for future improvement
============================

-	Improve on the aesthetics of display on the home page 	
-	Incorporate tabs to display the COMPLETED, ACTIVE, ALL todo items   
	 



User Stories
============

-   As a user, I would like to be able to separately display COMPLETED, ACTIVE AND ALL todos.     

-   As a user I would like to see the app hosted on heroku      

- 	As a user, I would like to have all permanently deleted records to be preserved in another storage (for purposes of history) 

-   Lastly, as a user, I would like to compliance with mobile first design - adapt to screen size changes without losing visibility
